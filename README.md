# ArduCAM
Lightweight version of the ArduCAM Library for use with ArduTom.  This library works only with the OV5642 ArduCAM model.
<br><br>
This project will be completed in a series of phases:
 * __Phase 1:__ _[COMPLETE]_ Removing anything not related to the OV5642
 * __Phase 2:__ Removing functions _for_ the OV5642 that we're not using
 * __Phase 3:__ Simplifying any remaining code to contain only what we need
 * __Phase 4:__ Updating header files and removing unused files
