This project will be completed in a series of phases:
 * _Phase 1:_ Removing anything not related to the OV5640 or OV5642
 * _Phase 2:_ Removing functions for the OV5642 that we're not using
 * _Phase 3:_ Simplifying any remaining code to contain only what we need
 * _Phase 4:_ Updating header files and removing unused files
